\title{Draw GOHeatmap containing Terms from TimeHeatmap and included Genes}
\usage{
draw_GOHeatmap(
  master.list,
  time.window = "",
  go.terms = "",
  merge.df = NA,
  logFC.thres = 2,
  figure.title = "",
  save.tiff.path = NA,
  tiff.res = 100,
  tiff.width = 1500,
  tiff.height = 1500
)
}
\arguments{
\item{master.list, }{a list object. The output from run_TrendCatcher function, contains master.table element.}

\item{time.window, }{a character. Must be one of the merge.df$t.name.}

\item{go.terms, }{a character array. Must be an array of go terms from the merge.df$Description.}

\item{merge.df, }{a dataframe. The output dataframe from output list of draw_TimeHeatmap_GO or draw_TimeHeatmap_enrichR. Use $merge.df to obtain it.}

\item{logFC.thres, }{a numeric variable. The logFC threshold compared to each genes previous break point expression level.
By default is 2, meaning for each gene, the current time window's expression level is 2-fold compared to previous
break point's expression level.}

\item{figure.title, }{character}

\item{save.tiff.path, }{by default is NA}

\item{tiff.res, }{resolution}

\item{tiff.width, }{figure width}

\item{tiff.height, }{figure height}
}
\value{
A list object, including elements named GOheatmap and GOheatmapDat. GOheatmap is a ComplexHeatmap object for figure. GOheatmapDat is a data.frame include log2FC
value of each gene's expression change compared to the previous break point.
}
\description{
This funcitons takes the master.list output from run_TrendCatcher, and merge.df output from draw_TimeHeatmap_GO and draw_TimeHeatmap_enrichR.
And showing all the genes used for enrichment analysis and their logFC compared to previous break point.
